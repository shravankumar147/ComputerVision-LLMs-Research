# ComputerVision-LLMs-Research

**Experimenting and Exploring the Intersection of Computer Vision & Deep Learning**

Welcome to **ComputerVision-LLMs-Research** – a playground where we push the boundaries of computer vision and deep learning while exploring innovative intersections with large language models (LLMs). This repository is dedicated to cutting-edge experiments, novel insights, and practical implementations in the field of AI.


## Overview

In today's fast-paced AI landscape, the convergence of computer vision and language models is opening up new avenues for research and application. Here, we experiment with:
- **Segmentation Models**: Dive into projects like *Segment Anything 2*, where state-of-the-art segmentation techniques are brought to life.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Learn through hands-on experiences on fine-tuning advanced networks to tackle real-world challenges.
- **Hugging Face Integrations**: Seamlessly incorporate Hugging Face models and pipelines to enhance your research workflow.
- **Kaggle Challenges**: Benchmark our experiments with exciting Kaggle datasets and competitions.
- **LLMs for Vision**: Explore the emerging role of large language models in enriching computer vision tasks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories, each dedicated to different aspects of our research:

- **`cv/segment-anything-2/`**  
  Experimenting with segmentation models to tackle object detection and segmentation challenges.

- **`finetuning/`**  
  A collection of fine-tuning experiments aimed at optimizing model performance on diverse datasets.

- **`hf/`**  
  Projects and notebooks integrating Hugging Face libraries for state-of-the-art model deployment.

- **`kaggle/`**  
  Data-driven projects leveraging Kaggle competitions and datasets to benchmark our models.

- **`llms/`**  
  Explorations into the use of large language models to enhance or complement computer vision workflows.

- **`docs/`**  
  Documentation, guides, and insights detailing our experiments, methodologies, and findings.

## Getting Started

To dive into our experiments locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shravankumar147/ComputerVision-LLMs-Research.git
   cd ComputerVision-LLMs-Research
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/) installed. We recommend using a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore Notebooks:**

   Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Then, navigate through the different directories to explore each experiment.
