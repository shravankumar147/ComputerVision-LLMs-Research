# Resume AI - Leveraging Computer Vision & LLMs

Welcome to the **Resume AI** project, where we explore the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Resume Parsing** to enhance the hiring process. This repository contains Kaggle Notebooks that showcase various approaches to resume ranking, parsing, and data processing using state-of-the-art AI tools like **Hugging Face** and **LangChain**.

## Key Features

- **Resume Ranking**: Analyze and rank resumes based on predefined criteria using AI models.
- **Parsing with Hugging Face & LangChain**: Extract relevant information from resumes using advanced AI tools.
- **Integration with LLMs**: Showcase how LLMs can be fine-tuned and integrated for domain-specific tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+
2. Kaggle account with the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Jupyter Notebook or an IDE that supports `.ipynb` files.

### Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the relevant directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shravankumar147/ComputerVision-LLMs-Research.git
cd ComputerVision-LLMs-Research/kaggle/resume_ai
```

### Running Notebooks
To run the notebooks, use the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Select the desired `.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface.

## Examples

### 1. Resume Ranking
The `01-resume-ranking.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to:
- Preprocess and vectorize resume data.
- Rank resumes based on their relevance to a given job description.

### 2. Parsing with Hugging Face & LangChain
The `03-hf-chain-parser.ipynb` notebook shows:
- How to parse resumes using pre-trained models from Hugging Face.
- Integrate LangChain for building structured workflows.

### 3. Combining Hugging Face Models and LangChain
The `hugging-face-models-with-langchain-for-resume-data.ipynb` notebook illustrates:
- Using Hugging Face models in LangChain for advanced resume processing tasks.
